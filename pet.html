    <h1>My Lovely Pet!</h1>

    <p> One lonely day ,I met a stray dog while I was working in the woods. I kept running away from it everytime it followed me. When I finally reached home that evening i saw it right behind me still!That is how I got a pet dog called Snowy. Snowy is white with black strips.He loves playing around with me a lot too.Unfortunetly,he is quite aggressive to new visitors around the house compound.As much as she is unfriendly, she still becomes my best friend especially in times of trouble.He can also swim a little and run very fast.Sadly,Snowy grew old and became blind last year.Thats a short story about Snowy,my pet dog.
